Phase 1 - Architecture & Core Features

Architecture & Core Features

  The application was built using the following architecture:
  Frontend: Streamlit for the user interface
  Backend: Python for calculations and data processing
  Database: PostgreSQL for data persistence
  Visualization: Plotly and Matplotlib for interactive charts
  
Core Features Implemented:

  Portfolio Allocation Tool: Visualize and adjust asset allocations with sliders
  Compound Growth Calculator: Project portfolio growth over time
  Fund Comparison Tool: Compare expense ratios across different fund providers

Phase 2 - Advanced Analysis Features

The second phase focused on implementing more sophisticated analysis tools:

Advanced Features:
  
  Tax Efficiency Advisor: Optimize fund placement across account types
  Monte Carlo Simulation: Run retirement projections with confidence intervals
  Financial Literacy Hub: Educational resources on the Bogleheads philosophy
  
The Monte Carlo simulation was implemented using NumPy's random number generators and statistical functions to create multiple potential future scenarios.
